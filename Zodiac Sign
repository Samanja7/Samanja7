Aquarius="""
Aquarius are strange set of people
They are MAd and Crazy
"""
Pisces="""
Pisces signs have a peaceful and gentle presence about them, with an uncanny ability to tap into the emotions of the collective. They're extremely malleable and need to be careful of who they surround themselves with. Since they are hyper-intuitive, they can sometimes become disconnectedâ€“making it important for this water sign to ground often.
"""
Aries="""
Aries are typically brave and outgoing. They're assertive by nature and won't hesitate to tell you how they feel. But they do need to be mindful that they don't hurt anyone's feelings by speaking impulsively. They can be headstrong at times, and make better leaders than followers.
